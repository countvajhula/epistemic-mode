rigpa
=====

Modular editing levels and towers for Emacs.

Rigpa allows you to construct structures relating editing modes (these
could be evil modes or hydras, or anything implementing a common modal
interface ("chimera")) and manipulate which structures are active at
any point in time.  It generalizes both vim's notion of editing mode,
as well as Emacs's notion of a major mode into a unified way of
looking at things, that is, as towers of modes which can be swapped
and themselves edited using the very modes they contain.

In addition, rigpa also defines conventions that modes should follow
in order to be seamlessly integrated into editing structures.  This
includes conventions around keybindings for moving up and down the
hierarchy of editing levels, standard semantics of modifier keys,
defining a canonical action for each mode, and other such conventions
to ensure semantic uniformity across editing levels.

Installation
============

This package isn't on `MELPA <https://melpa.org/>`_ yet, but you can install a pre-release version using `straight.el <https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el>`_ by putting this somewhere in your :code:`.emacs.d`:
